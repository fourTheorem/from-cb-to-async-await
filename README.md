# from-cb-to-async-await

[![Node.js CI](https://github.com/fourTheorem/from-cb-to-async-await/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fourTheorem/from-cb-to-async-await/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

A repository with some examples to learn how async code works in JavaScript from callbacks to promises to async/await.


## Requirements and dependencies

Requires Node.js v14 or newer.

Install all the necessary dependencies with:

```bash
npm i
```


## Examples

### [`01-simple-callback`](/01-simple-callback.js)

Shows the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript. It makes an HTTP request to the
[Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to fetch all the characters of the show.

Run it with:

```bash
node 01-simple-callback.js
```


### [`02-sequential-callbacks`](/02-sequential-callbacks.js)

Shows how to organise callbacks to perform sequential asynchronous actions.

Run it with:

```bash
node 02-sequential-callbacks.js
```


### [`03-simple-promise`](/03-simple-promise.js)

Shows how Promise work and how to convert callback-based code to Promise.

Run it with:

```bash
node 03-simple-promise.js
```


### [`04-sequential-promise`](/04-sequential-promise.js)

Shows how to organise Promise to perform sequential asynchronous actions.

Run it with:

```bash
node 04-sequential-promise.js
```


### [`05-simple-await`](/05-simple-await.js)

Shows how to use async/await with Promise.

Run it with:

```bash
node 05-simple-await.js
```


### [`06-sequential-await`](/06-sequential-await.js)

Shows how easy it is to do sequential asynchronous operations with async/await.

Run it with:

```bash
node 06-sequential-await.js
```
